        "Our team is currently developing a new platform that brings AI capabilities to all JetBrains products. Part of this platform is based on compact and efficient language models which help users write better text, no matter what JetBrains product they are using. We are looking for an ML Engineer who can contribute to our grammar error correction service within our writing assistance project. There are several open ideas which we would potentially like to explore:\n",

        "* Fine-tuning large language models for the grammar error correction tasks\n",
        "* Experimenting with ensembling and ranking of single-model systems\n",
        "* Adapting recent advances in text-editing to grammar error correction\n",
        "* Augmenting and enhancing our datasets using LLMs or alternative methods\n",

        "* Research and choose the metrics you want to use for evaluation.\n",
        "* Explore the existing spell checkers (e.g. libraries, fine-tuned models, LLMs), pick some you like and evaluate them on the created test set.\n",
        "* Analyse the results and think about the strengths and weaknesses of each spell checker, as well as the reasons for that. Think about how they could be improved.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, you should provide a link to a repository containing the source code and documentation, e.g.:\n",
        "\n",

        "* Documentation describing datasets, tools and metrics you used\n",
